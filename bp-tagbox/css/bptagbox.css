/* 
Basic layout structure styles for your BuddyPress component. The structure CSS performs
basic structural formatting on component's interface. Your structure CSS should provide
enough structure so that regardless of the theme enabled, your interface should still work.

No colors, fonts or pretty stuff.

These structure styles can be overridden by the theme CSS file if needed.
